 a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data 

# Description of Variables (if not self explanatory)
The test subject is represented by a number from 1 to 30. The activity performed can be one of LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS. The rest of the variables are self explanatory. The variables with a (t) are in the domain of time, while variables with a (f) are in the domain of frequency.
